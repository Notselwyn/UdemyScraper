# UdemyScraper

The user enters Udemy's access token and client id in the source code. 
Find it by going to https://udemy.com, clicking inspect element, going to the storage tab and going to cookies.
This is 100% safe and not infected. For the non technical people, the only URL requests made in this script is to Udemy.com and a site to scrape the coupons off.

I know this code is pretty bad, but I wanted to make a semi-light weighted scraper.

## Education
